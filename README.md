# 📊 Retail Sales Analysis Using Tableau
Welcome to the repository for my completed TATA Data Visualisation Virtual Experience Program hosted on The Forage. This simulation mimics real-world tasks performed by data analysts and visualisation professionals at TATA, focusing on insights-driven business reporting.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This virtual internship is designed to strengthen data analysis, storytelling, and dashboard creation skills using a real-world dataset from an online retail business. The project involves answering specific business questions raised by the CEO and CMO through insightful, clean, and interactive data visualisations.
