Hi, I’m Darshan

Good Morning, CEO and CMO.

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to present the insights from the online retail data analysis. My aim is to give you a clear understanding of customer behavior, revenue patterns, and expansion opportunities based on your business questions. 

I’ve carefully worked through the data to ensure the visuals you're about to see are both accurate and aligned with your goals.

**Let’s Approach the Overview**

To begin, I first explored the dataset thoroughly—this helped me understand what kind of information we had and what cleaning it needed.

I then focused on the four key questions you asked and prepared the data accordingly.

To make sure the insights were reliable:

- I filtered the data to only include transactions from the year 2011, since that was your area of interest.
- I also cleaned the data by removing any entries where the quantity was less than one and the unit price was zero or negative, as these are likely errors.

**[Question 1: Monthly Revenue Trends – 1:00 – 1:45]**

Jumping Straight to Question 1 — Monthly Revenue Trends

For the first question, the CEO wanted to view how revenue changed each month during the year 2011.

I created a line chart showcasing the monthly revenue.

The data shows a clear upward trend from the beginning of the year, peaking in November with over 1.5 million in revenue, I strongly believe that this spike is due to the holiday season, as people tend to buy more for Christmas and New year. 

The sharp drop in December could be due to order cancellations or post-holiday slowdowns.

This monthly pattern can help with planning inventory, marketing campaigns, and staffing for peak months like Nov-Dec next year.

**[Question 2: Top 10 Countries by Revenue – 1:45 – 2:30]**

Next, for the CMO, I identified the top 10 countries generating the highest revenue—excluding the United Kingdom, as per your request.

I used a combined bar chart to show both the **total revenue** and **quantity sold** side by side for each country.

We can clearly see that the **Netherlands, EIRE (Ireland), and Germany** are our strongest international markets after the UK. They not only brought in high revenue, but also showed strong product demand.

This visual helps you compare how much revenue each country generates alongside how many items were sold, which is useful for understanding customer value per country

Moving on, the third topic was to identify our **top 10 customers by revenue**.

Here, I created a bar chart showing customers ranked from the highest to the lowest revenue generators.

Our top customer alone brought in over 271,000 in revenue, which is a significant portion of our sales.

Targeting these top customers with loyalty programs or exclusive offers can help us retain them and encourage even more purchases. It’s also important to ensure they stay satisfied with our service.

Finally, the CEO wanted to know which countries outside the UK show the most demand, to identify future expansion opportunities.

I created a map visual showing **total quantity sold per country**.

This gives you a high-level view without the need to scroll or filter.

From this, we can see strong demand coming from countries like **the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Australia, and even parts of Asia like Japan and Hong Kong**.

These regions show promise for future marketing efforts or regional partnerships.

**[Closing and Recommendations – 4:00 – 5:00]**

In summary, here are the key takeaways:

- There’s a strong seasonal revenue trend peaking in November, which we should prepare advance for in future years, making sure to stock up inventory, create more marketing campaigns and even hiring temporary staff ahead of the peak time.
- The Netherlands and Ireland are top international performers excluding the U.K and should be prioritized in marketing.
- We should nurture our top 10 customers with offers, especially the highest spender, to drive long-term revenue.
- Finally, expansion opportunities are promising in select European and Asia-Pacific countries.

All the visuals I created were built to be interactive, so you can drill down further into any country or customer if needed.

Thank you again for your time. I'm confident these insights will help you make strategic decisions for growth, both in retaining high-value customers and expanding into promising regions.
